Cath Lab is a system we designed to keep track of San Joaquin Valley Hospital's Cath Lab inventory. All parts are to be scanned into the system and labeled with a unique generated barcode label. The system will keep track of when a part has been used or expired, and generates various cost and inventory stock reports.
